Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully tracked down the culprit! It seems you've pinpointed the individual behind the code that caused the issue. Well done for using your investigative skills to find the right person! 

It turns out thereâ€™s a branch dedicated to this very individual. Seems like youâ€™re getting closer to completing the challenge! ðŸŒŸ

**Riddle**:  
I lurk in the code, unseen at first,  
I cause programs to fail or work the worst.  
Iâ€™m a tiny mistake, hard to find,  
Yet fixing me makes everything aligned.  
What am I?

There is a branch with the name of the answer to this riddle. Go there for your next challenge!
